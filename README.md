#### The Influenza India dataset comprises epidemiological and virological data on influenza cases collected from various regions across India. The dataset typically includes information such as the number of laboratory-confirmed influenza cases, subtypes (influenza A and influenza B).This dataset is valuable for analyzing the seasonality and geographic variation of influenza in India. These data help inform public health strategies, vaccination timing, and response to outbreaks across diverse climatic and demographic settings in India. This project aims to build robust and accurate predictive models for influenza outbreaks using neural networks. The specific objectives are:
### To analyze and preprocess historical influenza data in India.
### To perform univariate time series forecasting
### To evaluate multiple forecasting models
### To identify the best-performing model for each subtype
### To provide insights for public health planning
